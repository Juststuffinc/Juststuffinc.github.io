What I'm working on and what I have made.


Hello, my name is Billy (otherwise known as Juststuffinc) and I am a semi independent game dev that specializes in C#! I work in Unity and the Source engine respectfully.

My current projects:

The Elevator Game (Working Title)

The Elevator Game is my main project right now. I am working with a team known as "Cool Group Games" who have had one game release in the past. You can check them out over on Itch! (https://coolgroup-games.itch.io/)

The game is a Survival Horror game that revolves around a mystery of some missing children.
