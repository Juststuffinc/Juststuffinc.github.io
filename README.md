What I'm working on and what I have made.


Hello, my name is Billy (otherwise known as Juststuffinc) and I am a semi independent game dev that specializes in C#! I work in Unity and the Source engine respectfully.

My current projects:
-----
The Elevator Game (Working Title)

The Elevator Game is my main project right now. I am working with a team known as "Cool Group Games" who have had one game release in the past. You can check them out over on Itch! (https://coolgroup-games.itch.io/)

The game is a Survival Horror game that revolves around a mystery of some missing children.

Test maps

This was my first actual attempt at mapping in the new Hammer editor.

I made this after watching the Eagle One Dev Team tutorials.

Messing around with dynamic prop animations.

This was a small test game I made in Unity to test shooting and throwing items; It's shitty but it got the job done.

Plans for S&Box
-----

Once S&Box enevitibly releases, I will be making a gamemode with the help of one other person revolving around LightSaber Duels. It will be using the fighting system that resembles the one in Jedi Knight Jedi Academy. In the game, you have to move your mouse around to do a swing move, I think that it would translate well into S&Box.


Screenshot from the game:

Another gamemode idea I have is a Zombie Wave Shooter type game where you are slowly able to upgrade items and place traps n' such. It would be similar in gameplay to "Zombie Builder Defense" on Steam
