Old Projects:
-----
Recently I have been wanting to challenge myself more and more and decided to get out of my comfort zone. One thing of Game-Design I haven't tried was well, animation. After getting some help with animating in blender, I have created a few (bad) animations.

Overall, the expirence I had animating was fairly fun! I had fun getting out of my comfort zone and doing something different.

(This map is supposed to be a backroom of an underground boxing ring.)

This was my first actual attempt at mapping in the new Hammer editor.

   (I really reccomened Eagle Teams Hammer tutorials if you are just starting out.)

Plans on hold

The Elevator Game (Working Title)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58781443/117677796-c854e500-b17c-11eb-909a-9b8304fe1a40.png)

The Elevator Game was my main project . I am working with a team known as "Cool Group Games" who have had one game release in the past. You can check them out over on Itch! (https://coolgroup-games.itch.io/)

The game is a Survival Horror game that revolves around a mystery of some missing children.

Other, smaller projects

This was a small test game I made in Unity to test shooting and throwing items; It's shitty but it got the job done.

Plans for S&Box
-----

Once S&Box enevitibly releases, I will be making a gamemode with the help of one other person revolving around LightSaber Duels. It will be using the fighting system that resembles the one in Jedi Knight Jedi Academy. In the game, you have to move your mouse around to do a swing move, I think that it would translate well into S&Box.


Screenshot from the game:

Another gamemode idea I have is a Zombie Wave Shooter type game where you are slowly able to upgrade items and place traps n' such. It would be similar in gameplay to "Zombie Builder Defense" on Steam
